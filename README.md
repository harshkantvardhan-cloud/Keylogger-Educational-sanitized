# Educational Keylogger — Sanitized Repository

This repository originally contained a keylogger for educational purposes. To keep this
project safe, the original capturing code has been removed and quarantined. The current
repository contains a harmless simulated demo and unit tests that demonstrate event
handling patterns without recording or transmitting real input.

**Quarantine & Safety**
- The original file (if present) was moved to `quarantine/keylogger_original.py` and has
	been deleted from the repository to prevent accidental execution.
- A `README_quarantine.md` is included with recommended remediation steps.

Use this repository only for learning safe event-handling techniques.

## Running the safe demo
Run the simulated demo which prints example events:

```powershell
& ".venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1"  # if you use the provided virtualenv
python safe_demo.py
```

## Tests
Run the unit tests with:

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -v
```

If you need help restoring or recovering any deleted files, or converting this into a
fully documented learning module, open an issue or ask here.
