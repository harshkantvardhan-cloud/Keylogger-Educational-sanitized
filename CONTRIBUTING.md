# Contributing and Safe-Use Policy

This repository is intended for educational purposes only. It contains a sanitized
demo that simulates keyboard events without capturing real user input.

Please follow these rules:
- Do not add or restore code that captures or transmits keystrokes, personally
  identifiable information, or other sensitive data.
- If you contribute code, ensure it is safe to run on a developer workstation and
  does not include persistence, remote exfiltration, or hidden behaviors.
- Open a Pull Request for any non-trivial changes and include tests and
  documentation.

If you need to recover the original file for forensic reasons, do that outside
of the public repository and follow responsible disclosure policies.
